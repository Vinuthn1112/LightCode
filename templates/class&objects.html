                <p>
                    Python is a versatile programming language that supports various programming styles, including object-oriented programming (OOP) through the use of objects and classes.<br><br>

                    An object is any entity that has attributes and behaviors. For example, a parrot is an object. It has<br><br>
                    <ul style="margin-left:50px" type="1">
                        <li>attributes - name, age, color, etc </li><br>
                        <li>behavior - dancing, singing, etc</li><br>
                        
                    </ul>
                    Similarly, a class is a blueprint for that object.<br><br>

                    In the above example, we created a class with the name Parrot with two attributes: name and age.<br><br>

                    Then, we create instances of the Parrot class. Here, parrot1 and parrot2 are references (value) to our new objects.<br><br>

                    We then accessed and assigned different values to the instance attributes using the objects name and the . notation.<br><br>

                    <b style="font-size: 20px;">Python Inheritance</b><br><br>
                    Inheritance is a way of creating a new class for using details of an existing class without modifying it.<br><br>

                    The newly formed class is a derived class (or child class). Similarly, the existing class is a base class (or parent class).<br><br>
                    <b>Example 2: Use of Inheritance in Python</b><br><br>
                    <img src="cb3.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>

                    <img src="cb4.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>
                    Here, dog1 (the object of derived class Dog) can access members of the base class Animal. It's because Dog is inherited from Animal.<br><br>
                    <img src="cb5.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>
                    <b style="font-size: 20px;">Python Polymorphism</b><br><br>
                    Polymorphism is another important concept of object-oriented programming. It simply means more than one form.<br><br>

                    That is, the same entity (method or operator or object) can perform different operations in different scenarios.<br><br>
                    
                    Let's see an example,   <br><br>
                    <img src="cb6.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>    
                    <b>OUTPUT:</b> <br><br>
                    <img src="cb7.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>
                    In the above example, we have created a superclass: Polygon and two subclasses: Square and Circle. Notice the use of the render() method.<br><br>

                    The main purpose of the render() method is to render the shape. However, the process of rendering a square is different from the process <br><br>
                    of rendering a circle.<br><br>
                    
                    Hence, the render() method behaves differently in different classes. Or, we can say render() is polymorphic. <br><br>                   
                    <b style="font-size: 20px;">Python Encapsulation</b><br><br>
                    Encapsulation is one of the key features of object-oriented programming. Encapsulation refers to the bundling of attributes and methods<br><br> inside a single class.<br><br>

                    It prevents outer classes from accessing and changing attributes and methods of a class. This also helps to achieve data hiding.<br><br>
                    
                    In Python, we denote private attributes using underscore as the prefix i.e single _ or double __. For example,<br><br>
                    <img src="cb8.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>    
                    <b>OUTPUT:</b> <br><br>
                    <img src="cb9.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>
                    In the above program, we defined a Computer class.

                    We used __init__() method to store the maximum selling price of Computer. Here, notice the code<br><br>
                    
                    <img src="cb10.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>
                    
                    Here, we have tried to modify the value of __maxprice outside of the class. However, since __maxprice is a private variable,<br><br> this modification is not seen on the output.<br><br>
                    
                    As shown, to change the value, we have to use a setter function i.e setMaxPrice() which takes price as a parameter.<br><br>

                <h2 class="d1_h2">Python Objects and Classes</h2><br><br>
                <p>
                    In the last tutorial, we learned about Python OOP. We know that python also supports the concept of objects and classes.<br><br>

                    An object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions). Similarly, a class is a blueprint for that object.<br><br>
                    
                    Before we learn about objects, let's first know about classes in Python.    <br><br>
                    <b style="font-size: 20px;">Python Classes</b><br><br>
                    A class is considered as a blueprint of objects. We can think of the class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. It contains all the details about the floors,<br><br>
                     doors, windows, etc. Based on these descriptions we build the house. House is the object.<br><br>

                    Since many houses can be made from the same description, we can create many objects from a class.   <br><br>
                    <b style="font-size: 20px;">Define Python Class</b><br><br> 
                    We use the class keyword to create a class in Python. For example,<br><br> 
                    <img src="cb11.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br> 
                    Here, we have created a class named ClassName.<br><br> 

                    Let's see an example,<br><br> 
                    <img src="cb12.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br> 
                    Here,<br><br>
                    <ul style="margin-left:50px" type="1">
                        <li> Bike - the name of the class</li><br>
                        <li>name/gear - variables inside the class with default values "" and 0 respectively.</li><br>
                        
                    </ul>
                    <img src="cb13.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br> 
                    <b style="font-size: 20px;">Python Objects</b><br><br> 
                    An object is called an instance of a class. For example, suppose Bike is a class then we can create objects like bike1, bike2, etc from the class.<br><br> 

                    Here's the syntax to create an object.    <br><br>
                    <img src="cb14.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>  
                    Let's see an example,<br><br>
                    <img src="cb15.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br> 
                    Here, bike1 is the object of the class. Now, we can use this object to access the class attributes.<br><br> 
                    <b style="font-size: 20px;">Access Class Attributes Using Objects</b><br><br> 
                    We use the . notation to access the attributes of a class. For example,<br><br>
                    <img src="cb16.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>   
                    Here, we have used bike1.name and bike1.gear to change and access the value of name and gear attribute respectively.  <br><br>  
                    <b style="font-size: 20px;">Example 1: Python Class and Objects</b><br><br> 
                    <img src="cb17.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>   
                    <b>OUTPUT:</b><br><br>  
                    <img src="cb18.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>  
                    In the above example, we have defined the class named Bike with two attributes: name and gear.<br><br>  

                    We have also created an object bike1 of the class Bike.<br><br>  
                    
                    Finally, we have accessed and modified the attributes of an object using the . notation.   <br><br> 
                    <b style="font-size: 20px;">Create Multiple Objects of Python Class</b><br><br>
                    We can also create multiple objects from a single class. For example,  <br><br>
                    <img src="cb19.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>
                    <b>OUTPUT:</b>  <br><br>   
                    <img src="cb20.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>     
                    In the above example, we have created two objects employee1 and employee2 of the Employee class.       <br><br> 
                    <b style="font-size: 20px;">Python Methods</b><br><br>
                    We can also define a function inside a Python class. A Python Function defined inside a class is called a method.<br><br>

                    Let's see an example,        <br><br>
                    <img src="cb21.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>
                    <b>OUTPUT:</b>  <br><br>   
                    <img src="cb22.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>   
                    In the above example, we have created a class named Room with:   <br><br> 
                    <ul style="margin-left:50px" type="1">
                        <li>Attributes: length and breadth</li><br>
                        <li>Method: calculate_area()</li><br>
                        
                    </ul>    
                    Here, we have created an object named study_room from the Room class. We then used the object to assign values to attributes: length and breadth.  <br><br>
                    <b style="font-size: 20px;">Python Constructor</b><br><br>   
                    Earlier we assigned a default value to a class attribute,    <br><br>  
                    <img src="cb23.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>   
                     
                    However, we can also initialize values using the constructors. For example,    
                    <img src="cb24.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br> 
                    Here, __init__() is the constructor function that is called whenever a new object of that class is instantiated.<br><br> 

                    The constructor above initializes the value of the name attribute. We have used the self.name to refer to the name attribute of the bike1 object.<br><br> 
                    
                    If we use a constructor to initialize values inside a class, we need       <br><br>  
                    <img src="cb25.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>  
                    Here, "Mountain Bike" is passed to the name parameter of __init__().       <br><br>            
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="d1" id="k3">
                <h2 class="d1_h2">Python Inheritance</h2><br><br>
                <p>
                    Like any other OOP languages, Python also supports the concept of class inheritance.<br><br>

                    Inheritance allows us to create a new class from an existing class.<br><br>
                    
                    The new class that is created is known as subclass (child or derived class)<br><br> And the existing class from which the child class is derived is known as superclass (parent or base class). <br><br>
                    <b style="font-size: 20px;">Python Inheritance Syntax</b><br><br> 
                    Here's the syntax of the inheritance in Python,  <br><br> 
                    <img src="pi1.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br> 
                    Here, we are inheriting the sub_class class from the super_class class.<br><br>     
                    <b style="font-size: 18px;">Example 1: Python Inheritance</b><br><br> 
                    <img src="pi2.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>
                    <b>OUTPUT:</b>    <br><br>
                    <img src="pi3.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br> 
                    In the above example, we have derived a subclass Dog from a superclass Animal. Notice the statements,  <br><br>  
                    <img src="pi4.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>  
                    Here, we are using labrador (object of Dog) to access name and eat() of the Animal class. <br><br> 
                    This is possible because the subclass inherits all attributes and methods of the superclass.<br><br> 

                    Also, we have accessed the name attribute inside the method of the Dog class using self.<br><br> 
                    <p style="color:rgb(35, 35, 128)">
                        is-a relationship<br><br> 

                        In Python, inheritance is an is-a relationship. That is, we use inheritance only if there exists an is-a relationship between two classes. For example,<br><br> 

                        Car is a Vehicle<br><br> 
                        Apple is a Fruit<br><br> 
                        Cat is an Animal<br><br> 

                        Here, Car can inherit from Vehicle, Apple can inherit from Fruit, and so on.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <b style="font-size: 20px;">Method Overriding in Python Inheritance</b><br><br>
                    In the previous example, we see the object of the subclass can access the method of the superclass.<br><br>

                    However, what if the same method is present in both the superclass and subclass?<br><br>

                    In this case, the method in the subclass overrides the method in the superclass. <br><br>This concept is known as method overriding in Python.<br><br>
                    <b>Example: Method Overriding</b><br><br>
                    <img src="pi5.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>
                    <b>OUTPUT:</b><br><br>

                    In the above example, the same method eat() is present in both the Dog class and the Animal class.<br><br>

                    Now, when we call the eat() method using the object of the Dog subclass, the method of the Dog class is called.<br><br>

                    This is because the eat() method of the Dog subclass overrides the same method of the Animal superclass.<br><br>
                    <b style="font-size: 20px;">The super() Method in Python Inheritance</b><br><br>
                    Previously we saw that the same method in the subclass overrides the method in the superclass.<br><br>

                    However, if we need to access the superclass method from the subclass, we use the super() method. For example,<br><br>
                    <img src="pi7.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>
                    <b>OUTPUT:</b><br><br>

                    In the above example, the eat() method of the Dog subclass overrides the same method of the Animal superclass.<br><br>

                    Inside the Dog class, we have used<br><br>
                    <img src="pi9.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>
                    to call the eat() method of the Animal superclass from the Dog subclass.<br><br>

                    So, when we call the eat() method using the labrador object<br><br>

                    <img src="pi10.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>
                    Both the overridden and the superclass version of the eat() method is executed.<br><br>
                    <b style="font-size: 20px;">Uses of Inheritance</b><br><br>
                    1.
                    Since a child class can inherit all the functionalities of the parent's class, this allows code reusability.<br><br>
                    2.Once a functionality is developed, you can simply inherit it. No need to reinvent the wheel. This allows for cleaner code and easier to maintain.<br><br>
                   3. Since you can also add your own functionalities in the child class, you can inherit only the useful functionalities and define other required features.<br><br>

                <p>
                    A class can be derived from more than one superclass in Python. This is called multiple inheritance.<br><br>

                    For example, A class Bat is derived from superclasses Mammal and WingedAnimal. It makes sense because bat is a mammal as well as a winged animal.<br><br>

                <h2 class="d1_h2">Python Operator Overloading</h2><br><br>
                <p>
                    In Python, we can change the way operators work for user-defined types.<br><br>

                    For example, the + operator will perform arithmetic addition on two numbers, merge two lists, or concatenate two strings.<br><br>
                    
                    This feature in Python that allows the same operator to have different meaning according to the context is called operator overloading.
                </p><br><br>
                <b style="font-size: 20px;">Python Special Functions</b><br><br>
                Class functions that begin with double underscore __ are called special functions in Python.<br><br>

                The special functions are defined by the Python interpreter and used to implement certain features or behaviors. <br><br>
                They are called "double underscore" functions because they have a double underscore prefix and suffix, such as __init__() or __add__().<br><br>

                Here are some of the special functions available in Python,  <br><br>
                <img src="mi5.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>                            
                <b>Example: + Operator Overloading in Python</b><br><br>  
                To overload the + operator, we will need to implement __add__() function in the class.<br><br>  

                With great power comes great responsibility. We can do whatever we like inside this function.<br><br>   But it is more sensible to return the Point object of the coordinate sum.<br><br>  

                Let's see an example,<br><br>  
                <img src="mi6.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>    
                In the above example, what actually happens is that, when we use p1 + p2, Python calls p1.__add__(p2) which in turn is Point.__add__(p1,p2). <br><br>  
                After this, the addition operation is carried out the way we specified.<br><br>  

                Similarly, we can overload other operators as well. The special function that we need to implement is tabulated below.<br><br>  
                <img src="mi7.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br> 
                <img src="mi8.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br> 
                <b style="font-size: 20px;">Overloading Comparison Operators</b><br><br>
                Python does not limit operator overloading to arithmetic operators only. We can overload comparison operators as well.<br><br>

                Here's an example of how we can overload the < operator to compare two objects the Person class based on their age:<br><br>
                <img src="mi9.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br><br>
                <b>OUTPUT:</b> <br><br>
                <img src="mi10.png" style="margin-left:150px"><br>  <br>  
                Here, __lt__() overloads the < operator to compare the age attribute of two objects.<br>  <br>  

                The __lt__() method returns,<br>  <br>  
                
                    True - if the first object's age is less than the second object's age<br>  <br>  
                    False - if the first object's age is greater than the second object's age<br>  <br>  
                
                Similarly, the special functions that we need to implement, to overload other comparison operators are tabulated below.   <br>  <br>

                <b>Advantages of Operator Overloading</b>  <br>  <br> 
                Here are some advantages of operator overloading,

               1. Improves code readability by allowing the use of familiar operators.<br>  <br> 
               2. Ensures that objects of a class behave consistently with built-in types and other user-defined types.<br>  <br> 
                3.Makes it simpler to write code, especially for complex data types.<br>  <br> 
                4.Allows for code reuse by implementing one operator method and using it for other operators.<br>  <br>
